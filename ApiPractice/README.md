# API Practice
This lesson provides some self-paced guided activities the students can follow to strengthen their API skills. Students can complete them on their own, or an instructor can walk through one as a group activity. Students are also welcome to continue working on previous activities or examples.

The other purpose of this session is to introduce the final project. At minimum, students should brainstorm ideas, and by the end of the session, they should know which API they would like to use (or decide not to use one). They are welcome to use one of the APIs from these activities or previous examples, as long as they add enough originality to their sites.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- See a wider range of API possibilities
- Strengthen their API skills
- Incorporate more HTML into API-driven web applications
- Recognize the power of APIs
- Develop a plan for their final project

## Guided Activity: Color Schemer
Students can follow [these instructions](ColorSchemer.md) to update a website that generates color schemes.

## Guided Activity: TV Characters
Students can follow [these instructions](TvCharacters.md) to update a website that displays pictures of television program characters.

## Guided Activity: Emoji Crush
Students can follow [these instructions](EmojiCrush.md) to create a website that displays a random emoji.

## Final Project Introduction
At some point during the session, introduce the [final project](../FinalProject/). Students are welcome to start working on their final project right away. They are free to use any APIs, activities, or examples as starting points.

**By the end of the session, make sure that each student has an idea for a project.** If they choose to use an API, they should know which API they will use.
