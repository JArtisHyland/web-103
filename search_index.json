create and customize an interactive quiz. These instructions use Ash Ketchum as an example subject, but make sure to change the questions and answers to be about you!\nPart 1 - Setup\nStart by forking the existing project. It contains all of the HTML and CSS, but none of the JavaScript.\n\nNote: You must be logged into Replit to fork the project\n\n\nClick here to open the starter project\nClick the \"Fork Repl\" button in the upper right\nClick the \"Fork Repl\" button in the pop-up that appears\nRun the project to see how it looks!\n\nEverything should show up on the page, but the button will not be functional yet...\nPart 2 - Hooking Up the Button\nThere is currently no JavaScript code, so nothing happens when the button is clicked! Take a look at the  element in the HTML:\nStart the Quiz\n\nThe onclick attribute is trying to call a function named startQuiz - you have to define it!\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top, define a function named startQuiz\nfunction keyword\nFunction name (startQuiz)\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the function\nBetween the curly brackets\n\n\nThere, add an alert statement that says \"Loading...\"\nRun the project again, click the button, and verify that a pop-up appears!\n\nThe code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction startQuiz() {\n  alert(\"Loading...\");\n}\n\nPart 3 - Adding a Personal Greeting\nThe button is working, but it's not doing anything too exciting yet. Welcome the user to the quiz with a personalized message using the name they entered in the text input!\n\nMake a new line in the body of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named nameInput\nSet the nameInput value to get the  element from the HTML\nUse document.querySelector to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named name\nSet the name value to get the actual text from the nameInput element\nUse .value to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, add an alert that says \"Hello, NAME! Get ready for some questions...\"\nMake the message into a template string, and replace \"NAME\" with ${name} to use the text from the box\nRun the project again, enter a name in the text box, click the button, and verify that the greeting is personalized!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet nameInput = document.querySelector(\"#name\");\nlet name = nameInput.value;\n\nalert(`Hello, ${name}! Get ready for some questions...`);\n\nPart 4 - Preparing the Score\nNow it's time to get into the quiz! Start by setting up some storage variables to keep track of the player's score.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named score\nSet the score value to 0 to start\nUnder that, create a new variable named numQuestions\nSet the numQuestions value to 3.0 for now\nThe .0 is for calculation purposes\n\n\n\nNote that nothing will actually change when clicking the button again - these variables will be used a bit later. The additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet score = 0;\nlet numQuestions = 3.0;\n\nPart 5 - Asking One Question\nNow that the variables are initialized, this quiz needs some questions! Start with this one:\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhat is my name?\nAsh Ketchum\n\n\n\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a variable named answer1\nSet answer1 to the result of a prompt asking \"What is my name?\"\nUnder that, create an if statement\nif keyword\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nFor the condition (between parentheses), check if answer1 is equal to \"Ash Ketchum\"\nUse === to compare the two\n\n\nIn the body of the if (between curly brackets), make a new line\nThere, set score to be score + 1\nThis increases the score by 1!\n\n\nClick the button, and verify that the new prompt appears!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nlet answer1 = prompt(\"What is my name?\");\nif (answer1 === \"Ash Ketchum\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nPart 6 - Asking More Questions\nAdditional questions will use almost exactly the same code as the first question. The only things that will change are:\n\nThe answer variable name (e.g., answer2 instead of answer1)\nThe question text (e.g., \"Where do I live?\" instead of \"What is my name?\")\n\nOther than that, you can follow the steps from Part 5 to add each additional question! Add at least two more:\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I live?\nKanto\n\n\nWhat is my cat's name?\nPikachu\n\n\n\n\nNote: If there are more or less than three questions, the value of the numQuestions variable will need to change\n\nThe code for the additional questions should look something like this:\nlet answer2 = prompt(\"Where do I live?\");\nif (answer2 === \"Kanto\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nlet answer3 = prompt(\"What is my cat's name?\");\nif (answer3 === \"Pikachu\") {\n  score = score + 1;\n}\n\nNow the quiz is complete, but the player has no idea if they got the questions right or wrong!\nPart 7 - Calculating and Displaying the Result\nAt this point, the startQuiz function knows the number of correct answers (stored in the score variable), so the final result can be calculated. There will be a little math involved, and then the player will get a nice message saying whether they passed or failed.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, add an alert that says \"Calculating...\"\nUnder that, create a variable named scorePercent\nSet the scorePercent variable to be 100 times score divided by numQuestions\nThis is their final percentage based on how many they got right\n\n\nUnder that, create an if/else structure\nif keyword\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\nelse keyword\nMore curly brackets\n\n\nFor the condition (between parentheses), check if scorePercent is greater than 60\nIn the body of the if, use an alert to say \"You passed 😎\"\nIn the body of the else, use an alert to say \"You failed 😭\"\nRun the project, take the quiz, and make sure the calculation is correct!\n\nThe additional code within the body of the startQuiz function should look something like this:\nalert(\"Calculating...\");\nlet scorePercent = 100 * (score / numQuestions);\n\nif (scorePercent > 60) {\n  alert(\"You passed 😎\");\n} else {\n  alert(\"You failed 😭\");\n}\n\nPart 8 - Revealing the Final Score\nA simple \"pass\" or \"fail\" is nice, but the player might want to know their exact score. There is actually already a  element in the HTML just for this purpose! Its text can update dynamically based on the quiz result.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a new variable named scoreElement\nSet the scoreElement value to get the  element from the HTML\nUse document.querySelector to accomplish this\n\n\nSet the text of the  to a message saying \"You got SCORE correct (PERCENT%)\"\nUse .textContent to accomplish this\n\n\nMake the message into a template string, and replace \"SCORE\" and \"PERCENT\" with ${score} and ${scorePercent}\nThis will use the actual score and percentage values\n\n\nRun the project, take the quiz again, and verify that the correct score appears on the page after it!\n\nThe added code should look something like this:\nlet scoreElement = document.querySelector(\"#score\");\nscoreElement.textContent = `You got ${score} correct (${scorePercent}%)`;\n\nPart 9 - Presenting the Stars\nThe quiz is functionally complete now, but the player might want a bit more of a prize for their efforts. Add some star images to the page based on how many questions the player got right!\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the startQuiz function\nThere, create a for loop structure\nfor keyword\nParentheses (())\nCurly brackets ({})\n\n\nAdd statements within the parentheses to repeat a number of times\nlet i = 0;\ni \ni++\n\n\nMake the loop repeat score times instead of NUMBER times\nThis way, the code in the loop will run once for every correct answer\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the loop (between curly brackets)\nThere, create a new variable named starImg\nSet starImg to be a newly created  element\nUse document.createElement to accomplish this\n\n\nUnder that, set the src of starImg to be \"star.png\"\nThe star.png file should already be loaded into the Repl project\n\n\nUnder that, append the starImg element to the body of the page\nUse document.body.appendChild to accomplish this\n\n\nRun the project, take the quiz again, and see how many stars you see!\n\nThe added code should look something like this:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nConclusion\nAnd that's it! The quiz should be fully functional and fully fun. The code in the script.js file should look something like this at the end:\nfunction startQuiz() {\n  alert(\"Loading...\");\n\n  let nameInput = document.querySelector(\"#name\");\n  let name = nameInput.value;\n\n  alert(`Hello, ${name}! Get ready for some questions...`);\n\n  let score = 0;\n  let numQuestions = 3.0;\n\n  let answer1 = prompt(\"What is my name?\");\n  if (answer1 === \"Ash Ketchum\") {\n    score = score + 1;\n  }\n\n  let answer2 = prompt(\"Where do I live?\");\n  if (answer2 === \"Kanto\") {\n    score = score + 1;\n  }\n\n  let answer3 = prompt(\"What is my cat's name?\");\n  if (answer3 === \"Pikachu\") {\n    score = score + 1;\n  }\n\n  alert(\"Calculating...\");\n  let scorePercent = 100 * (score / numQuestions);\n\n  if (scorePercent > 60) {\n    alert(\"You passed 😎\");\n  } else {\n    alert(\"You failed 😭\");\n  }\n\n  let scoreElement = document.querySelector(\"#score\");\n  scoreElement.textContent = `You got ${score} correct (${scorePercent}%)`;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i \nNext Steps: Self-Paced Work\nClick here for self-paced work instructions!\n"},"JsReview/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"JsReview/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Quiz Updates\nMake some updates to your personal quiz website!\n1. More Custom Questions\nFill out your quiz with more questions about yourself! Add as many as you can, and make sure to update the numQuestions variable so the final score calculation is accurate.\n2. HTML & CSS Updates\nCurrently, the webpage really only serves as a way to start the quiz. Make it your own by adding information, updating the color scheme, and anything else you'd like to do!\n3. Multiple Choice Questions\nThe fill-in-the-blank style of the questions is a little easier to program, but it makes the questions much harder. Update the questions so that they show a list of possible answers! A question could look something like this:\nWhere do I live?\n\nA) Kanto\nB) Banto\nC) Ranto\nD) Flanto\nThe user could then enter A or a, so the answer variable could be checked against that.\n4. Different Images\nStars are cool, but you might be able to find something better. Search the internet for an appropriate victory icon, and replace the star.png url in the JavaScript with the new URL!\n5. (BUG) Extra Stars\nCurrently, if a player completes the quiz more than once, all the additional stars are appended to the page - they are never removed! Figure out how to remove the star  elements whenever the quiz starts, so that the number of stars will always match the number of correct answers.\n6.

Get rid of all alert and prompt statements in the startQuiz function, and replace them with HTML elements!\nFor example, for the first question, you could add HTML like this:\nWhat is my name?\n\n\nThen, instead of setting the answer1 variable based on a prompt, you could grab the value from the  like this:\nlet answer1Input = document.querySelector(\"#answer1\");\nlet answer1 = answer1Input.value;\n\nFrom there, the answer1 variable could be used in the same way.\nDOM Dropdowns or Radio Buttons\nAnother option would be to use  dropdowns or  buttons for a multiple choice quiz.\n\nDropdowns\nRadio Buttons\n\nThe code may need a little more updating, but the user experience will be excellent!\n"},"Arrays/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Arrays/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 2 - Arrays","keywords":"","body":"Arrays\nLearn how to use arrays to store multiple values in one variable.\nWarm-Up Activity: Top Ten Restaurants\nClick here for the warm-up activity instructions.\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nCode-Along: Movie Watchlist\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Movie Watchlist Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nChallenges\nClick here for some additional challenges.\nResources\n\nW3Schools Introduction to Arrays\n\n"},"Arrays/WarmUp.html":{"url":"Arrays/WarmUp.html","title":"Warm-Up","keywords":"","body":"Warm-Up: Top Ten Restaurants\nFollow these instructions to build a top ten list of your favorite restaurants.\n\nOpen the Top Ten Restaurants Website\nDelete any restaurants that are not in your top ten\nEdit existing restaurants to update their positions\nAdd new restaurants (at least three) to the bottom of the list\n\nBy the end of the activity, your page should have ten total restaurants, ranked 1-10!\n"},"Arrays/WatchlistCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Arrays/WatchlistCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Movie Watchlist\nFollow these instructions to build a movie watchlist website!\nGetting Started\nTo begin, fork this Starter Repl project. It contains some HTML and CSS, but no JavaScript yet 😓\nCreating the Array\nThe first step is to create the array that will store the list of movies.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the top of the file, create a new variable named moviesToWatch\nSet it equal to a new array with square brackets: [ and ]\nIn the array, add three string values, separated by commas:  \n\"The Lego Movie\"\n\"Despicable Me\"\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"\n\n\n\nFeel free to change up the films if desired! The code should end up looking something like this:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nDefining the displayList Function\nNow it's time to start making the buttons functional. In the index.html file, there is a  with an onclick set to call the displayList function... but it doesn't exist yet! It must be defined.\n\nMake a new line under the existing code in the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named displayList:  \nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing purposes\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Display List\" button properly executes the code in the newly defined function! It should look something like this:\nfunction displayList() {\n  alert(\"Displaying List...\");\n}\n\nLooping Through the Array\nNow that the button is hooked up to a function, we have to make sure the function actually does something! The goal is for this function to display each movie in the moviesToWatch array. This will be possible with a for loop!\n\nDelete the alert from the body of the displayList function\nIn its place, create the basic for loop structure:  \nfor\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nFor the first expression of the loop in the parentheses (init), create a variable i and set it to 0\nFor the second expression (cond), check if i is less than the length of the array\nFor the final expression (inc), add one to the value of i\nNow, in the body of the for loop (between { and }), create a new variable movieTitle\nSet the movieTitle variable to be the value in the moviesToWatch array at the current index\nUnder that, use an alert to display the current movieTitle\n\nRun the project, click the \"Display List\" button, and verify that all movie titles are displayed! The code in the body of the displayList function should look something like this:\nfor (let i = 0; i \nDisplaying Movies in HTML\nShowing the movies in pop-ups is functional, but the user experience could definitely be better. Use some DOM manipulation to add the array items to the HTML list instead!\nGetting the List Element\nThe first step will be to grab the HTML  so that we can add things to it.\n\nMake a new line at the top of the body of the displayList function\nThere, create a new variable named listElement\nSet the value of listElement to be the HTML element with an id of list\nUnder that, set the innerHTML of the listElement variable to be empty\n\nNothing should change at this point, but storing the listElement value will make it possible to add list items for each movie! The additional JavaScript code should look something like this: \nlet listElement = document.querySelector(\"#list\");\nlistElement.innerHTML = \"\";\n\nCreating the List Items\nNow that the  has been attained, it will be possible to add some list items! All of this will take place in the body of the for loop.\n\nIn the body of the for loop (within the displayList function), remove the alert statement\nIn its place, create a new variable named itemElement\nSet the value of itemElement to be a newly-created HTML  element\nUnder that, set the textContent of the itemElement variable to be the current movie title\nUnder that, append itemElement to listElement\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that the movies are added to the page as bulleted list items! The additional code should look something like this:\nlet itemElement = document.createElement(\"li\");\nitemElement.textContent = movieTitle;\n\nlistElement.appendChild(itemElement);\n\nDefining the addMovie Function\nNow the basic list is all set up, but what if we want to add a new movie? There is an \"Add Movie\" button, but its function does not exist yet! Let's define it.\n\nMake a new line under the existing code in the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named addMovie:  \nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing purposes\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Add Movie\" button properly executes the code in the newly defined function! It should look something like this:\nfunction addMovie() {\n  alert(\"Adding Movie...\");\n}\n\nGetting the New Movie\nNow the button has been hooked up, but the function needs to do a lot more than it's currently doing! To start, it needs to get a new movie from the user.\n\nIn the body of the addMovie function, create a new variable named movieToAdd\nSet the value of movieToAdd to be the result of a prompt statement\nSet the text of the prompt to ask \"Which movie do you want to add?\"\n\nRun the project, and verify that clicking the \"Add Movie\" button will now prompt the user for a new movie! The added code should look something like this:\nlet movieToAdd = prompt(\"Which movie do you want to add?\");\n\nAdding the New Movie\nNow we have the movie they want to add, so we can add it to the array!\n\nMake a new line under the movieToAdd variable, still in the body addMovie\nCall the push function on the moviesToWatch array\nPass in movieToAdd as the argument for the function\nUnder that, call the displayList function to update the HTML\n\nRun the project, and verify that a new movie can be added to the list on the page! The added code should look something like this:\nmoviesToWatch.push(movieToAdd);\ndisplayList();\n\nThe basic functionality of the Movie Watchlist should now be working as expected!\nFinal Code\nBy the end of the activity, the JavaScript code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nfunction displayList() {\n  let listElement = document.querySelector(\"#list\");\n  listElement.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n  for (let i = 0; i \n"},"Arrays/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Arrays/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Movie Watchlist Updates\nFollow these instructions to update the movie watchlist website.\nNumbered HTML List\nCurrently, the list displays with bullet points. Update the code in the index.html file to make the list display as an ordered list.\nMore Different Starting Movies\nCurrently, there should be three movies when the moviesToWatch array is initially created. Under that, add some new movies to the list! In addition to adding new movies, update some of the existing movies as well.\nRemember, to add an item to an array, use the push function. It should look something like this for an array named myArray:\nmyArray.push(\"My new item\");\n\nTo update an existing value in an array, use the array name, square brackets, and the index of the value. It should look something like this for an array named myArray:\nmyArray[1] = \"My updated second item\";\n\nNote that the updates to the array values should not happen when the array is initially created! The line below should remain the same:\nlet moviesToWatch = [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"];\n\nMovie Edits\nCurrently, there is no way to adjust a movie once it has been added to the Watchlist. Create a button that will allow the user to do this!\nAdding a Button in HTML\nThe first step is to create a new HTML button element.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the existing  elements (within a ), and make a new line under the last one\nThere, create a new  element\nSet the onclick of the button to call a function named editMovie\nSet the text of the button to say \"Edit a Movie\"\n\nRun the project, and verify that a new button appears! It should not do anything yet, though.\nHooking Up the Button in JavaScript\nNow it's time to make the button run some code.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a couple new lines at the bottom of the file\nThere, define a new function named editMovie\nfunction keyword\nFunction name\nParentheses ()\nCurly brackets {}\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), add an alert statement for testing\n\nRun the project, and verify that a pop-up message appears when the \"Edit a Movie\" button is clicked!\nGetting the Index of the Value to Update\nNext, grab the index of the movie from the user. Remember, to convert a string to a number, use code that looks something like this:\nlet myString = \"47\";\n\nlet myNumber = Number(myString);\n\n// myNumber will be the number 47 instead of the text \"47\"\n\n\nRemove the alert from the body of the editMovie function\nIn its place, create a new variable named idxString\nSet idxString to a prompt\nSet the text for the prompt to say \"Enter the index of the movie you would like to edit.\"\nUnder that, create a new variable named idx\nCall the Number function on idxString to set the value of idx\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that the prompt appears!\nGetting the New Value\nNext, grab the new title the user would like for the given index.\n\nMake a new line in the body of the editMovie function\nOn that line, create a new variable named newTitle\nSet newTitle to a prompt\nSet the text for the prompt to say \"Enter a new value for the movie title.\"\n\nRun the project, click the button, and verify that two prompts appear!\nSetting the New Title\nNow it's time to actually update the list! Remember, to set the value of an array at a certain index, use code that looks something like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Banana\", \"Apple\"];\nlet myIndex = 1;\n\nmyArray[myIndex] = \"Orange\";\n\n// myArray will be [\"Banana\", \"Orange\"]\n\n\nMake a new line in the body of the editMovie function\nOn that line, value of the moviesToWatch array at the index of idx to be newTitle\nUnder that, call the displayList function to update the HTML\n\nRun the project, and test out the \"Edit a Movie\" button! At this point, it should be fully functional 😎\nChallenge 1 - Item Number Instead of Index\nCurrently, the editMovie function will edit an item by its index. For example, if the user entered 1 for the index, it would edit the second item in the array. Update this so that instead of using the index directly, it subtracts one from what the user enters; that way, if for example the user enters 2 for the item they want to edit, it will edit the item at index 1 (the actual 2nd element)!\nChallenge 2 - Deleting a Movie\nCurrently, there is no way to remove a movie from the watchlist. Add a button that allows the user to delete an item by its index!\nCreating a Button\nStart by creating a new  element in the index.html file. Set its onclick attribute to call a function named deleteMovie. Then, in the script.js file, define the function named deleteMovie.\nGetting the Index\nGetting the index to delete will be very similar to the editMovie function. Use a prompt to get the index string value, and then make sure to convert it to a number using the Number function! After this step, you should have a variable named idx that holds the index to delete.\n\nFor a more friendly user experience, subtract 1 from this idx before using it - that way, the number will line up with the position in the displayed list.\n\nRemoving the Value from the Array\nRead through these instructions to learn how to remove the value at the idx index.\nBackground\nUnfortunately, there is not a direct way to do this in JavaScript; however, the splice method generally works fairly well. Here is an example, and here is some more in-depth documentation. It can end up looking something like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Planes\", \"Trains\", \"Scooters\", \"Automobiles\"];\nlet indexToDelete = 2;\nlet numberOfElementsToDelete = 1;\n\nmyArray.splice(indexToDelete, numberOfElementsToDelete);\n\n// myArray will be [\"Planes\", \"Trains\", \"Automobiles\"]\n\nThere are many ways to use splice, but if you just want to remove a value, you can pass in the index of the value to delete as the first argument, and 1 as the second argument. This will delete 1 element at that index.\nCode to Add\nFor the deleteMovie function, use the splice function to remove one value at the idx index. Remember, moviesToWatch is the array name, splice is the function, idx is the first argument, and 1 is the second argument.\nAfter the splice, make sure to call the displayList function to update the HTML on the page!\nConclusion\nAt this point, the \"Delete a Movie\" button should be fully functional. Run the project, click on the button, enter an index, and verify that the item disappears from the list!\nChallenge 3 - Persistent Movies\nThis challenge will require a bit of additional research. The goal is to store the list of movies somewhere so that if a user reloads the page, it remembers what the movies were.\nBackground: Local Storage\nThis is possible using something called localStorage - it's basically a way to store data in the browser for a given user. This can make basic front-end web applications much more powerful!\nlocalStorage has two main functions: storing values (setting), and retrieving values (getting).\nSetting an Item\nSetting an item looks like this:\nlet myValue = \"This will be stored\";\n\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myValue\", myValue);\n\nGetting an Item\nIf an item has already been stored, you can get it like this:\nlet myValue = localStorage.getItem(\"myValue\");\n\nBackground: JSON Strings\nThe localStorage object can only store string values - this means that we cannot directly store an array. However, it is possible to work around this using JSON strings. Essentially, we can convert an array to a string to store it, and then convert it back to an array when we grab it.\nArray to String\nTo convert an array into a string, use JSON.stringify like this:\nlet myArray = [\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\"];\n\nlet myString = JSON.stringify(myArray);\n\n// myString will be the string version of the array: `[\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\"]`\n\nString to Array\nTo convert a string into an array, use JSON.parse like this:\nlet myString = `[\"Sunday\",\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\"]`;\n\nlet myArray = JSON.parse(myString);\n\n// myArray will be the actual array object: [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\"]\n\nBackground: localStorage + JSON Strings\nCombine these two concepts to successfully store array objects within localStorage! Here is a brief explanation.\n// Storing myArray in localStorage\nlet myArray = [\"Leonardo\", \"Raphael\", \"Donatello\", \"Michelangelo\"];\nlet myArrayString = JSON.stringify(myArray);\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myArray\", myArrayString);\n\n// Retrieving myArray from localStorage\nlet myStoredArrayString = localStorage.getItem(\"myArray\");\nlet myStoredArray = JSON.parse(myStoredArrayString);\n\n// At this point, myStoredArray will contain the array object from myArray!\n\nImplementation: Updating the Movie Watchlist\nAfter trying to grasp the concepts of localStorage and JSON strings, apply them to the Movie Watchlist website!\nStoring the Movies Array\nA good place to store the current movies would be in the displayList function.\n\nGo to the bottom of the displayList function\nCreate a new variable named stringToStore\nCall the JSON.stringify function on moviesToWatch, and store it in the stringToStore variable\nUnder that, call the localStorage.setItem function\nPass in \"moviesToWatch\" as the first argument, and stringToStore as the second argument\n\nThis should successfully store the value in localStorage every time the user clicks the \"Display List\" button. It is possible to check this out by opening up developer tools, going to the \"Application\" window, and clicking on the \"localStorage\" option. Here is a quick example - it's not necessary to look at it there, but it's pretty cool!\nRetrieving the Movies Array\nNow that the movies array has been stored, it can be retrieved! Instead of setting the moviesToWatch array statically at the top of the file, use localStorage to check if there is a stored version of the array.\n\nAt the very top of the file, create a new variable named storedMoviesString\nCall the localStorage.getItem function, passing in \"moviesToWatch\" as the argument\nSet storedMovieString to this value\n\n\nUnder that, create the moviesToWatch variable - but with no value!\nUnder that, create an if/else structure\nFor the if condition, simply pass in storedMoviesString\nThis checks if the variable has any value\n\n\nIn the body of the if (between { and }), set the moviesToWatch variable\nCall JSON.parse, and pass in storedMoviesString - store that result inb moviesToWatch\nIn the body of the else, set the moviesToWatch variable to the original starter array\n\nNow, the first time the page loads, it should set the moviesToWatch array to [\"The Lego Movie\", \"Despicable Me\", \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"]. However, if the user decides to add, edit, or delete any movies, the moviesToWatch array should update, and persist to localStorage. When the page is loaded again, it should retrieve the stored movie list!\n"},"Arrays/Challenges.html":{"url":"Arrays/Challenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Challenges\nTry to complete these challenges that deal with a playlist website.\nStart by forking this Repl project. Then, try to update the site in a variety of ways! Feel free to hop around whichever challenges interest you the most.\nChallenge 1 - Updating the Picture\nThe jumbotron header has a background image, but it might not be something you like. Find another picture online, add it to your Repl project, and update the background-image property in the style.css file!\nChallenge 2 - Updating the Colors\nThe colors are designed to match the background image of the jumbotron. Update any of the colors in the style.css file to match your own personal taste!\nChallenge 3 - Updating the Songs\nThere are currently six songs in the playlist. Update some of these songs so that they reflect your favorite songs! This should take place in the script.js file.\nNote that the string values in the songs array are formatted in a specific way: \"Song Title|Artist\". Make sure your new songs fit that format, with the song title first, then a pipe character (|), then the song artist.\nTry to modify the songs array without changing the first line of the script.js file! Use .push, or songs[1] = \"Soemthing|Else\", to change the values in the array.\nChallenge 4 - No More \"Fill Playlist\" Button\nCurrently, it is necessary to click the \"Fill Playlist\" button in order to add songs to the playlist. Fix this so that the songs are added automatically when the page loads! This is possible by using the  defer attribute to make sure the JavaScript code runs after the HTML has been parsed. \n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nAdd a defer attribute to the  element\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the very bottom, under the fillPlaylist function\nCall the fillPlaylist function directly\n\nReload the page, and the songs should appear automatically without having to click a button!\nChallenge 5 - Album Column\nCurrently, the songs array stores two pieces of information for each song - the song title, and the song artist. Update the songs array so that each string contains an album as well, and then modify the code so that it displays an album column!\nReview some of these resources to learn more:\n\nThe split function\nExample\n\n\nDestructuring assignment\n\nThen, try to apply those concepts:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the songs array, modify each string by adding a | to the end\nAfter each new |, add an album title (feel free to make stuff up)\nWithin the fillPlaylist function, in the for loop body, find where the currentSong.split happens\nTo the left of that, add album to the title and artist variables being set\nUpdate the column sizes for title and artist\nChange \"col-sm-5\" to \"col-sm-4\" for both\n\n\nCreate another HTML  element for the album title\nAdd \"col-sm-2\" to its classList\nSet its textContent to the album variable set above\nAppend the created album  to the songRow element\n\nRun the project, and see the albums show up in the list!\nChallenge 6 - Playing Actual Songs\nThe most hardest part of this challenge may be finding audio files, so do not worry too much about that. The more technical challenges may also be difficult!\nFunction for the Play Buttons\nIt will be beneficial to learn more about anonymous functions to accomplish this. Basically, it is possible to pass around JavaScript functions as objects, and they do not need names. This allows custom, dynamic functionality to be applied at different points in the code. Here's a brief example:\nlet myNamelessFunction = function () {\n  alert(\"This is a function\");\n}\n\nmyNamelessFunction();\n\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nIn the body of the fillPlaylist function, within the for loop, find where the playBtn variable is set\nSet the onclick of the playBtn to be a new anonymous function\nIn the body of the anonymous function, use an alert to display a pop-up with the title of the current song title\n\nRun the code at this point to make sure each play button is hooked up!\nPlaying Audio\nThe next step will be to actually play some audio. You will want to find some audio files and pull them into your Repl project first. Once you have done that, you can play them! It looks something like this:\nlet audio = new Audio(\"audio_file.mp3\");\naudio.play();\n\nYou can adjust the files so that each file matches the song title... for example, if the song title is \"Baba O'Riley\", the file should be called Baba O'Riley.mp3. That way, you can get the filename from the title like so:\nlet filename = `${title}.mp3`;\n\nIt should then be possible to play it! Try it out and see if you can get it working.\nChallenge 7 - Adding and Deleting Songs\nUpdate this website so that it has more of the functionality from the Movie Watchlist!\n\nCreate a button that allows a user to add a song to the end of the list\nNext to each item in the list, create a button that allows the user to remove that item from the list\n\nThis may be quite challenging, but it is definitely possible 😁\nChallenge 8 - Saving the List with localStorage\nSimilar to the challenge from the Self-Paced Work, try to use localStorage to store the songs array so it persists! This challenge only makes sense if the challenge above has been completed.\n"},"Objects/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Objects/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 3 - Objects & JSON","keywords":"","body":"Objects & JSON\nLearn how to use objects to store related pieces of data within one variable.\nWarm-Up Activity: Character Builder\nClick here for the warm-up activity instructions.\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nCode-Along: Food Picker\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Food Picker Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nResources\n\nW3Schools Introduction to Objects\nW3Schools Introduction to JSON\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO Object Basics\nMDN Guide to Working with Objects\n\n"},"Objects/WarmUp.html":{"url":"Objects/WarmUp.html","title":"Warm-Up","keywords":"","body":"Warm-Up: Character Builder\nIn this warm-up, build a character and assign them some traits.

Start by creating a new object for Panera.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nMake sure it's outside of the getFood function (after the })\n\n\nThere, create a new variable named panera\nSet panera to be a new empty object with { and }\nPress Enter to automatically add space between\n\n\nIn the object, create a name property set to \"Panera\"\nProperty name, colon, property value, comma\n\n\nUnder that in the object, create an items property set to []\n\nThe new code should look something like this:\nlet panera = {\n  name: \"Panera\",\n  items: []\n};\n\nIt will not change the functionality of the site yet - it needs at least one item!\nCreating a Greek Salad Object\nStart by adding a Greek Salad to the Panera items.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, create a new variable named greekSalad\nSet greekSalad to be a new empty object with { and }\nPress Enter to automatically add space between\n\n\nIn the object, create a price property set to 10\nProperty name, colon, property value, comma\n\n\nUnder that in the object, create a picture property set to \"greeksalad.jpg\"\nNote that there is a file in the pictures folder named greeksalad.jpg\n\n\n\nThe new code should look something like this:\nlet greekSalad = {\n  price: 10,\n  picture: \"greeksalad.jpg\"\n};\n\nIt still will not do anything yet... it needs to be added!\nAdding the Greek Salad Object\nNow the greekSalad is almost ready, but there are a couple things still needed before it will show up as a food item.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, set the name property of the greekSalad object to be \"Greek Salad\"\nThis ensures that it has a name for the display!\n\n\nUnder that, push the greekSalad object to the panera.items array\nUnder that, push the panera object to the restaurants array\n\nAt this point:\n\nThe name property has been added to the greekSalad object\nThe greekSalad object has been added to the panera object items array\nThe panera object has been added to the restaurants array\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Greek Salad eventually appears! Note that it may be helpful to remove the alert statement from the top of the getFood function for usability purposes. Replit also runs slowly sometimes, so if the image is not changing, it may be necessary to wait several seconds.\nThe additional code should look something like this:\ngreekSalad.name = \"Greek Salad\";\npanera.items.push(greekSalad);\nrestaurants.push(panera);\n\nCreating and Adding a Mac n Cheese Object\nNow it will be possible to add new items in a few different ways! Add a Mac n Cheese item to the Panera menu.\n\nNote: Even though the panera object has already been pushed, updating its properties will still update the object - that's because JavaScript recognizes objects by reference\n\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, create a new variable named mac\nSet mac to be a new empty object with { and }\nPress Enter to automatically add space between\n\n\nIn the object, create a name property set to \"Mac n Cheese\"\nProperty name, colon, property value, comma\n\n\nUnder that in the object, create a price property set to 7\nUnder that in the object, create a picture property set to \"macncheese.jfif\"\nNote that there is a file in the pictures folder named macncheese.jfif\n\n\nUnder that, outside the object (after }), make a new line\nThere, push the mac object to the panera.items array\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Mac n Cheese eventually appears! The additional code should look something like this:\nlet mac = {\n  name: \"Mac n Cheese\",\n  price: 7,\n  picture: \"macncheese.jfif\"\n};\n\npanera.items.push(mac);\n\nCreating and Adding a Soup Object\nIt is also possible to add a new item directly without creating a separate variable! Add Soup to the possible Panera food items in this manner.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nPush a currently empty object to the panera.items array\nAdd a name property to the pushed object set to \"Soup\"\nAdd a price property to the pushed object set to 6\nAdd a picture property to the pushed object set to \"panerabread.jpg\"\n\nRun the project, click the button a few times, and verify that the Soup eventually appears! The additional code should look something like this:\npanera.items.push({\n  name: \"Soup\",\n  price: 6,\n  picture: \"panerabread.jpg\"\n});\n\nConclusion\nThat's it for the code-along activity! At this point, it should be possible to click the button, and see a variety of different foods appear.\nThe added code in the script.js file should look something like this:\nfunction getFood() {\n  let randomRestaurantIndex = getRandomInt(restaurants.length);\n  let restaurant = restaurants[randomRestaurantIndex];\n\n  let restaurantItems = restaurant.items;\n  let randomItemIndex = getRandomInt(restaurantItems.length);\n  let item = restaurantItems[randomItemIndex];\n\n  let foodNameElement = document.querySelector(\"#food-name\");\n  let foodNameText = `${item.name} (${restaurant.name})`;\n  foodNameElement.textContent = foodNameText;\n\n  let foodPictureElement = document.querySelector(\"#food-pic\");\n  let foodPictureUrl = `pictures/${item.picture}`;\n  foodPictureElement.src = foodPictureUrl;\n}\n\nlet panera = {\n  name: \"Panera\",\n  items: []\n};\n\nlet greekSalad = {\n  price: 10,\n  picture: \"greeksalad.jpg\"\n};\n\ngreekSalad.name = \"Greek Salad\";\npanera.items.push(greekSalad);\nrestaurants.push(panera);\n\nlet mac = {\n  name: \"Mac n Cheese\",\n  price: 7,\n  picture: \"macncheese.jfif\"\n};\n\npanera.items.push(mac);\n\npanera.items.push({\n  name: \"Soup\",\n  price: 6,\n  picture: \"panerabread.jpg\"\n});\n\nNext Steps\nClick here to view the self-paced work instructions.\n"},"Objects/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Objects/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work\nFollow these instructions to update the Food Picker website.\nNew Items\nFeel free to add any new items desired!

Instead of doing this, ask the user which restaurant they would like to visit, and then choose randomly from that restaurant's items.\nHTML: Restaurant Name Input Element\nStart by creating a new element in the HTML where the user can enter a restaurant name.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the opening  element with the welcome message\nMake a new line under that, and create a new  element\nSet the text to say \"Enter a restaurant: \"\nAfter that, within the  and , create an  element\nSet the id of the  to be \"restaurant\"\n\nRun the project and verify that the text box appears on the page.\nJavaScript: Getting the Restaurant Name\nNext, select the new  element, and get its value.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the top of the getFood function\nThere, create a new variable named restaurantNameInput\nSet restaurantNameInput to select the  element\nUsing document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named restaurantName\nSet restaurantName to be the value of the restaurantNameInput variable\n\nNow the name is ready to go.\nJavaScript: Finding the Restaurant Object\nOnce the name has been retrieved, it will be possible to use it to find the proper object for the restaurant.\n\nUnder the restaurantName variable, make a couple new lines in the getFood function\nThere, create a new variable named restaurant (not set to anything)\nUnder that, create a new variable named found, set to false\nNext, create a for loop to loop through each element in the restaurants array\nfor\nParentheses\nCurly Brackets\nInitialization (let i = 0)\nCondition (i )\nIncrement (i++)\n\n\nIn the body of the for loop, create an if statement\nif\nParentheses\nCurly Brackets\n\n\nFor the condition, check if restaurants[i].name is equal to restaurantName\nThis means the current index contains the restaurant the user entered\n\n\nIn the body of the if, set the restaurant variable to `restaurants[i]\nUnder that, set the found variable to true\nUnder that, use a break statement to exit the loop\n\nNow the restaurant variable should be ready to go! Make sure to comment out the two lines that randomly choose the restaurant variable.\nRun the project, enter a restaurant name, and click the button. It should only choose food items from that restaurant! It's not perfect, though...\nJavaScript: Dealing with Unfound Restaurants\nCurrently, when entering a restaurant name that is not found, the page should fail. Fix this by handling unfound restaurants.\n\nUnder the for loop, create an if statement\nif\nParentheses\nCurly Brackets\n\n\nSet the condition to check if found is false using !found\nIn the body of the if, copy the old code that found a random restaurant\nRemove the let from the restaurant variable because it has already been declared\n\n\n\nRun the project, enter a name that does not exist, and verify that it chooses randomly from all restaurant items!\nCHALLENGE: Vegetarian Filter\nThere may be some vegetarians who visit the site - these people would not like to see any items that contain meat. Update the code so they can select only vegetarian items!\nHTML: Vegetarian Only Checkbox\nStart by creating a new element in the HTML where the user can check whether they'd like only vegetarian items.\n\nOpen the index.html file for editing\nFind the  element with the restaurant name \nMake a new line under that, and create a new  element\nSet the text to say \"Vegetarian items only? \"\nAfter that, within the  and , create an  element\nSet the type of the  to be \"checkbox\"\nSet the id of the  to be \"veg\"\n\nRun the project and verify that the checkbox appears on the page.\nJavaScript: Getting the Checkbox Value\nNow the checkbox is there, but its value must be retrieved.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the restaurantItems variable declaration\nMake a new line above the variable\nThere, create a new variable named vegetarianCheckbox\nSet vegetarianCheckbox to select the  element\nUsing document.querySelector\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named vegOnly\nSet vegOnly to be the checked property of the vegetarianCheckbox variable\n\nNow the function knows if non-vegetarian items should be filtered out, but it still does not know which items are vegetarian!\nJavaScript: Vegetarian Property\nCurrently, the item objects do not have a property denoting which items are vegetarian.\nGo through each item object, within the restaurants variable and manually add a veg property - it should be set to true of the item can be vegetarian, and false if the item contains meat.\nJavaScript: Filtering the List\nThere is a very helpful filter function that makes it possible to filter arrays based on functions that return booleans. Passing functions as variables and using arrow function syntax are concepts that will be covered later in this course. For now, try to figure out how to use filter even if you don't fully understand it!\n\nUnder the restaurantItems variable in the getFood function, make a new line\nThere, create an if statement\nFor the condition, check if vegOnly is true\nIn the body, set the restaurantItems variable to a call to restaurantItems.filter\nFor the filter call, pass in a function checking if an item has a veg property set to true\nitem => item.veg\n\n\n\nRun the project, check the box, and verify that only vegetarian items appear!\n"},"Callbacks/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Callbacks/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Functions & Callbacks","keywords":"","body":"Functions & Callbacks\nLearn how to use functions as objects and pass them into other functions!\nWarm-Up: Function Machine Game\nClick here for the warm-up activity instructions.\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nCode-Along: Funktional Functions\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Funktional Functions Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nChallenges\nClick here for some additional challenges.\nResources\n\nW3Schools Introduction to Callbacks\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO Function Basics\n\n"},"Callbacks/WarmUp.html":{"url":"Callbacks/WarmUp.html","title":"Warm-Up","keywords":"","body":"Warm-Up: Function Machine\nIn JavaScript, functions are a way to run a piece of code on-demand.

Take a look at the current code in the script.js file:\n\nbassAudio object and playBass function definition - these make it possible to play an audio track!\nchooseRandom function definition - this makes it possible to choose a random item from an array, and exclude any item in particular\nMany document.querySelector calls - these will all store HTML elements in variables to make them easier to access later in the code\n\nThere is a lot of setup, but nothing is actually functional yet. Run the project and notice that none of the buttons actually work!\nHooking Up the Bass Button\nAll of the bass-playing functionality is ready to go, but the function is not being called anywhere! Hook it up to the button with addEventListener.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nNotice the \"🎸 ⏯\"  element has an id of \"play-pause-bass\"\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nNotice the playPauseBassButton variable stores the proper HTML button\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCall addEventListener on the playPauseBassButton object\nPass in \"click\" as the first argument\nPass in playBass as the second argument\nNote: this is the actual function as a variable, not a function call!\n\n\n\nRun the project again, click the \"🎸 ⏯\" button, and verify that Bootsy Collins starts playing!\nThe added line of code should look something like this:\nplayPauseBassButton.addEventListener(\"click\", playBass);\n\nDefining the Random Background Filter Function\nNow the \"🎸 ⏯\" button is good to go - the next button to hook up is the \"Swap Color\" button. This one doesn't have a function defined yet, but the function should change the background filter to a random color.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, create a new variable named randomBgFilter\nSet randomBgFilter to be a new function\nfunction keyword\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function (between { and }), make a new line\nThere, set the backgroundColor of backgroundFilterDiv.style to \"yellow\"\n\nNothing will change quite yet... the randomBgFilter function still needs to be hooked up to the proper button! The new function code should look something like this:\nlet randomBgFilter = function() {\n  backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor = \"yellow\";\n}\n\nHooking Up the Swap Color Button\nNow a basic version of the function is ready, but it needs to be hooked up.\n\nOpen the index.html file\nNotice the \"Swap Color\"  element has an id of \"color-swapper\"\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nNotice the colorSwapperButton variable stores the proper HTML button\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCall addEventListener on the colorSwapperButton object\nPass in \"click\" as the first argument\nPass in randomBgFilter as the second argument\nNote: this is the actual function as a variable, not a function call!\n\n\n\nRun the project again, click the \"Swap Color\" button, and verify that the filter changes to yellow!\nThe added line of code should look something like this:\ncolorSwapperButton.addEventListener(\"click\", randomBgFilter);\n\nFilling Out the Random Background Filter Function\nAt this point, the randomBgFilter function is doing something, but it's not working quite right. Instead of only setting the color to yellow, it should choose a random color from an array.\n\nMake a new line at the top of the body of the randomBgFilter function\nThere, create a new variable named currentColor\nSet currentColor to backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor\nThis is the current filter color so the function can make sure it's a new color this time\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named colors\nSet colors to be an array containing red, orange, yellow, cyan, green, and purple\nUnder that, create a new variable named randomColor\nSet randomColor to be a call to chooseRandom\nThis function is defined earlier in the script.js file\n\n\nPass in colors as the first argument, and currentColor as the second\nThis will choose a random color while avoiding the current color\n\n\nNext, change the \"yellow\" to randomColor so it uses the randomly chosen color\n\nRun the project, click the \"Swap Color\" button a bunch, and verify that there is a new color each time! The body of the randomFilterBg function should look something like this:\nlet currentColor = backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor;\nlet colors = [\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"cyan\", \"green\", \"purple\"];\nlet randomColor = chooseRandom(colors, currentColor);\nbackgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;\n\nDefining the Start Cycle Function and Hooking Up the Button\nNow, it's pretty funkalicious that the background color can change. However, it would be even more funkalicious if it could happen automatically! This is possible with setInterval, and the randomBgFilter function already defined.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nDefine a new function named startCycle\nfunction keyword\nFunction name (startCycle)\nParentheses\nCurly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the startCycle function (between { and }), make a new line\nThere, call the setInterval function\nPass in randomBgFilter as the first argument, and 250 as the second\nThis will cause the function to run once every 250ms\n\n\nOutside the function definition, make a new line\nHook up the startCycleButton to run the startCycle function when clicked\nUse startCycleButton.addEventListener\n\n\n\nRun the project, click the \"Start Cycle\" button, and see the colors cycle automatically!\nThe code should look something like this:\nfunction startCycle() {\n  setInterval(randomBgFilter, 250);\n}\n\nstartCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", startCycle);\n\nStopping the Cycle: Tracking the Cycle Interval Id\nNow the cycle has begun, but there is no way to stop it! That could get annoying. Luckily, there is a way to keep track of any currently running function intervals - the setInterval function will return an ID value that can be used to track its usage.\n\nMake a new line above the startCycle function definition\nThere, define a new variable named cycleIntervalId (do not set it to anything)\nIn the body of the startCycle function, set cycleIntervalId to the value returned from setInterval\nNext, wrap the setInterval call in an if statement\nFor the if condition, check if cycleIntervalId is unset using !cycleIntervalId\nThis means there is not currently an interval running\n\n\n\nThis will not change any functionality yet, but it will now be possible to stop the interval. The added code should look something like this: \nlet cycleIntervalId;\n\nfunction startCycle() {\n  if (!cycleIntervalId) {\n    cycleIntervalId = setInterval(randomBgFilter, 250);\n  }\n}\n\nDefining the Stop Cycle Function and Hooking Up the Button\nAll that's left is to define a new function to stop the cycle, and hook it up to the proper button.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named stopCycle\nIn the body of the stopCycle function, call the clearInterval function\nPass in cycleIntervalId to the clearInterval call\nThis will stop the startCycle function from running\n\n\nUnder that, still in the body, set the cycleIntervalId to null\nThis ensures that a new cycle will be able to start\n\n\nOutside the function definition, make a new line\nHook up the stopCycleButton to run the stopCycle function when clicked\nUse stopCycleButton.addEventListener\n\n\n\nRun the project, start the cycle, and make sure the \"Stop Cycle\" button makes it stop! The code at the bottom should look something like this:\nfunction stopCycle() {\n  clearInterval(cycleIntervalId);\n  cycleIntervalId = null;\n}\n\nstopCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", stopCycle);\n\nConclusion\nThis code-along showed a small sample of what is possible with event listeners and intervals. Almost anything on a website can be controlled with these tools!\nBy the end of the activity, the additional code in the script.js file should look something like this:\n// Hook up Bass Button\nplayPauseBassButton.addEventListener(\"click\", playBass);\n\n// Define a function to change the background to a random color filter\nlet randomBgFilter = function() {\n  let currentColor = backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor;\n  let colors = [\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"cyan\", \"green\", \"purple\"];\n  let randomColor = chooseRandom(colors, currentColor);\n  backgroundFilterDiv.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;\n}\n\n// Hook up the \"Swap Color\" button to call the function\ncolorSwapperButton.addEventListener(\"click\", randomBgFilter);\n\n// Prepare Interval ID - this will keep track of the currently running function\nlet cycleIntervalId;\n\n// Start the cycle if there is not one currently running\nfunction startCycle() {\n  if (!cycleIntervalId) {\n    cycleIntervalId = setInterval(randomBgFilter, 250);\n  }\n}\n\n// Hook up Start Cycle Button\nstartCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", startCycle);\n\n// Stop any currently running cycle\nfunction stopCycle() {\n  clearInterval(cycleIntervalId);\n  cycleIntervalId = null;\n}\n\n// Hook up Stop Cycle Button\nstopCycleButton.addEventListener(\"click\", stopCycle);\n\nNext Steps\nClick here to view the self-paced work instructions.\n"},"Callbacks/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"Callbacks/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Funktional Functions Updates\nFollow these instructions to update the Funktional Functions website.\nNew Cycle Speed\nCurrently, when the color cycle is running, it changes colors once every 250 milliseconds.

No row should be highlighted when no song is playing.\nDouble Click Row to Play\nCurrently, the only way to play a track is to click the play button. Make it possible to play a track by double clicking anywhere on the row instead!\nShuffle\nCurrently, the songs should play in sequential order. Add an option that will play the tracks in a random order instead!\nPause\nCurrently, it is only possible to stop a track completely. If a song is stopped, it will start over when it is played again (instead of picking up where it left off). Add the ability to pause a track instead of stopping it completely.\nSUPER CHALLENGE: Reordering\nAdd the ability for a visitor to the site to reorder the playlist to their liking. This challenge will be quite difficult.\n"},"ArrowFunctions/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 5 - Arrow Functions","keywords":"","body":"Arrow Functions\nLearn a new, shorter way to define functions!\nPowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nReview: Worksheet\nClick here to view the worksheet.\nCode-Along: Cereal Mascots For Some Reason\nClick here for the code-along starter code.\nClick here for the code-along instructions.\nSelf-Paced Work: Trading Card Updates\nClick here for the self-paced work instructions.\nResources\n\nJAVASCRIPT.INFO - Arrow functions, the basics\nW3Schools - Arrow Function\n\n"},"ArrowFunctions/Worksheet.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/Worksheet.html","title":"Worksheet","keywords":"","body":"\n"},"ArrowFunctions/MascotsCodeAlong.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/MascotsCodeAlong.html","title":"Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Code-Along: Cereal Mascots for Some Reason\nIn this code-along, create a website that showcases cereal mascot trading cards for some reason.\nSetting Up\nClick here to go to the Cereal Start project.\nStart by forking the Repl. There is a decent amount of starter code.\nHTML Starter Code\nThe index.html file has some basic elements, including:\n\nA  that calls a function named filterList when clicked\nA container  with an id of mascot-container\nA  that links to the style.css file\nA  that pulls from the script.js file\nThis is at the bottom of the  element so that it runs deferred\n\n\n\nCSS Starter Code\nThere is quite a bit of CSS code in the style.css file - most of this is to make card flipping work later. Do not worry too much about it, but know there is a .flipped selector that will be of great importance.\nJavaScript Starter Code\nThere is one variable in the script.js file - mascots. This is an array containing objects, each object with some properties about a different cereal mascot. This code-along is all about displaying that data in an engaging way!\nImages\nAlso of note, there are some images in the images folder. The image filenames are referenced by the mascots objects (e.g., tony.png).\nBeginning\nThere is a lot of setup, but nothing is actually functional yet. Run the project and notice that no mascots appear!\nName Cards: Text\nThe first step is to simply display the names of each mascot in the mascots array. This will be possible using the map function, and the forEach function.\nThe Basics\nStart by defining and calling the function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nAt the bottom, define a new function named displayCards\nUnder the definition, call the function\n\nIt won't do anything yet, but here's how the code should look:\nfunction displayCards() {\n\n}\n\ndisplayCards();\n\nMapping the Data\nThe next step is fairly involved, even though it only ends up being a single line of code. There is a lot of background information before the actual code appears - make sure it is fully understood!\nBackground: Getting Text Nodes\nEach piece of data from the mascots array should be converted into an HTML text node containing its name. To explain this, start by thinking about how that would be possible for a single mascot object. Here's an example:\nlet tony = {\n  name: \"Tony the Tiger\",\n  cereal: \"Frosted Flakes\",\n  image: \"tony.png\",\n  type: \"animal\",\n  description: \"Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\"\n}\n\nThe name could be stored in another variable, like this:\nlet tonyName = tony.name;\n\nThat could be converted into a text node like this:\nlet tonyNode = document.createTextNode(tonyName);\n\nNow, because there are multiple mascots, each piece of text can end with a dot to separate them. Instead of simply tonyName, the text could be a template literal like this:\nlet tonyText = `${tonyName}. `;\n\nSo, to put it all together, if there were an object like tony, it could be converted into a text node like this:\nlet tonyTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${tony.name}. `);\n\nBackground: Getting Text Nodes Function\nIn order to actually use this process on every element in mascots, it will be necessary to convert the \"text-node-ification\" of an object into a function. The function should take in a mascot object, and return a text node. A good old-fashioned function declaration might look something like this:\nfunction mascotToNode(mascot) {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\nThat's functional, but an expression could be cleaner. Converting that function declaration into an anonymous function could go something like this:\n// remove name\nfunction (mascot) {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\n// replace 'function' with '=>'\n(mascot) => {\n  let mascotTextNode = document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n  return mascotTextNode;\n}\n\n// simplify body\n(mascot) => {\n  return document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n}\n\n// remove curly brackets and use implicit return\n(mascot) => document.createTextNode(`${mascot.name}. `);\n\n// shorten parameter name\n(m) => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\n// remove parameter parentheses\nm => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\nAnd there we have it! A clear, concise function expression that takes a mascot with a name and turns it into a text node!\nActually Mapping the Data to Text Nodes\nNow that there's a function to create a text node from one object, it should be possible to create text nodes for all objects. It is possible with map! It's time to get back into the actual code!\n\nIn the body of the displayCards function, name a new line\nThere, define a new variable named mascotsHtml\nSet mascotsHtml to a call to mascots.map\nRemember, the passed function will run on each element in mascots\nThe results will be stored in the mascotsHtml variable\n\n\nBetween the ( and ), pass in the function expression from above m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `);\n\n\n\nThat's it! Now, there is an array that contains a bunch of text nodes, one for each piece of data. It should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `));\n\nAdding the Text to the Page\nNow that there are a bunch of nodes, it will be necessary to throw them into the container.\nGetting the Container\nThe first step is to grab the container from the HTML, and store it in a JavaScript variable.\n\nMake a new line in the displayCards function body\nCreate a new variable named container\nSet container to a call to document.querySelector\nPass in '#mascot-container' to grab \n\nThe line should look something like this:\nlet container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n\nAppending Each Node\nNext, use forEach to call appendChild on each node in the mascotsHtml array!\n\nMake a new line in the body of the displayCards function\nCall forEach on the mascotsHtml variable\nPass in an arrow function expression that takes one parameter: m\nIn the body of the expression, call container.appendChild on m\n\nThe line should look something like this:\nmascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n\nTesting\nNow, run the project and see what happens! It should create text nodes from all the objects in the mascots array, and append them all to the . The added code in the script.js file should end up looking something like this:\nfunction displayCards() {\n  let mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => document.createTextNode(`${m.name}. `));\n\n  let container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n  mascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n}\n\ndisplayCards();\n\nName Cards: Cards\nAlright, so the site doesn't look great so far. It's just some text. We want each mascot to have their own card because that would be great for them. To start, create cards that simply have the name of each mascot. It will use an actual HTML  element instead of simply a text node.\n\nFind the mascots.map line in the displayCards function\nAdd curly brackets to the function expression\nRemove the body of the function expression, so it becomes m => { }\nMake a new line between { and }\nThere, create a new variable named mascotCard\nSet mascotCard to a call to document.createElement(\"div\")\nThis will be the actual card!\n\n\nUnder that, set the textContent of mascotCard to be m.name\nFinally, return mascotCard\nNote that return is required because there are { and }\n\n\n\nThe updated code should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(m => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n});\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the names are displayed on cards!\nTrading Cards: HTML\nOkay, it's starting to come together a little bit. But... each card should have so much more. Each card should display:\n\nThe picture\nThe name\nThe cereal\n\nEach card should also flip over on click, revealing the description on the back. How is this possible????\nAn Example\nTo see how this will look, there is some HTML to copy:\n\n  \n    \n    Tony the Tiger\n    Frosted Flakes\n  \n  Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\n\n\nPaste that into the container :\n\n\n\n\nRun the project to see how it looks! The goal will be to programmatically write up all that HTML for each element in the array.\nTrading Cards: Breaking Out the Function\nThis could get a little complex, so it will actually be a little easier to move the \"mascot-card-creation\" function expression somewhere else. This is not strictly necessary, but should make the code easier to write and maintain.\n\nNote: this is an example of refactoring: the functionality should actually stay the same for now, but it will be easier to improve it later!\n\nMoving\nStart by pulling the function expression code out of the map.\n\nIn the body of displayCards, find the mascots.map call\nCut the whole function parameter expression\nThis means copy it and delete it\n\n\nPaste it above the displayCards function\n\nAt this point, the code should look something like this:\nm => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\nfunction displayCards() {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nNaming\nNext, in order to actually use this function expression, it needs to be stored somewhere!\n\nDefine a new variable named objectToCard\nSet it to the function expression\nAdd a semi-colon at the end\n\nIt should look like this:\nlet objectToCard = m => {\n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mascotCard.textContent = m.name;\n\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\nPassing\nNow, all that's left is to pass that function into the map function! This will run it on every element in the mascots array, and convert them all into HTML objects.\n\nFind the mascots.map function call\nBetween the parentheses, pass the function variable (objectToCard)\n\nIt should look something like this:\nlet mascotsHtml = mascots.map(objectToCard);\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the cards still appear as they did before!\nTrading Cards: Data to HTML\nNow it's time to update that objectToCard function so that it creates better cards.\nStatic HTML\nStart by replacing every card with the raw HTML from before, containing the information about Tony the Tiger.\n\nFind the objectToCard function expression body\nRemove the line that sets the textContent\nIn its place, create a new variable named cardHTML\nSet cardHTML to a new template literal, and make some new lines between the backticks\nFor now, paste in the HTML from within the containing  above\nTwo  elements, the first with an , , and \nNote: Do not copy the containing  element!!\n\n\nUnder that, set the innerHTML property of the mascotCard object to be cardHTML\n\nThe updated code in the body of the objectToCard should now look something like this:\nlet cardHTML = `\n  \n    \n    Tony the Tiger\n    Frosted Flakes\n  \n  Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s...\n`;\n\nmascotCard.innerHTML = cardHTML;\n\nRun the project again. Now, you should see your website with all tonys. It's pretty close - just needs the specific data!\nDynamic HTML\nLuckily, each time objectToCard is called, there is a parameter that has all the data for each individual mascot. This is all stored in the m object, under m.image, m.name, m.cereal, and m.description. Using ${expression} notation, it will be possible to put this data into the HTML!\n\nFind the cardHTML template string (between backticks), and get ready to update it\nReplace tony.png with ${m.image}\nReplace Tony the Tiger with ${m.name}\nReplace Frosted Flakes with ${m.cereal}\nReplace Tony began to be humanized in the 1970s... with ${m.description}\n\nThe updated code should end up looking something like this:\nlet cardHTML = `\n  \n    \n    ${m.name}\n    ${m.cereal}\n  \n  ${m.description}\n  `\n\nNow, each run through the function will pull directly from the mascots array data! Run the project again, and verify that each mascot has their own card.\nTrading Cards: Flipping\nThe cards are looking great! You know what's even cooler than the cards are looking great? The cards should be able to flip when clicked. This will be possible using addEventListener, and another arrow function expression.\n\nFind the body of the objectToCard function expression\nMake a new line under the mascotCard.innerHTML line\nThere, call mascotCard.addEventListener\nFor the first argument, pass in \"click\"\nFor the second argument, create a new arrow expression\nStart with empty parentheses: ()\nThen, the arrow symbol: =>\nThen, curly brackets: {}\n\n\nClick between { and } and press enter to make a new line\nThere, call the mascotCard.classList.toggle function\nThis will add a class if it's not there, and remove it if it is\n\n\nPass in \"flipped\" as the argument\nThis class controls the CSS determining whether a card is flipped or not\n\n\n\nThe added code should look something like this: \nmascotCard.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  mascotCard.classList.toggle(\"flipped\");\n});\n\nRun the project again, and verify that the cards all flip over and show the mascot descriptions when you click them!\nFiltering the Cards\nEverything is looking pretty great now! But there is still the matter of that non-functional \"Filter\" button. It should be able to filter the cards shown based on their type property. This may not seem like a big deal now, but if there were 100 mascots, it would be very useful!\nParameterization\nRight now, every time the displayCards function runs, it uses the mascots array to show the cards. This will not work if we do not always want to use that array! The first step is to parameterize the displayCards function so that it can display any array of mascots.\n\nFind the displayCards function definition\nBetween the parentheses, add mascotsArray as a parameter\nIn the body, replace mascots with mascotsArray\nFind where displayCards is called\nThere, between the parentheses, add mascots\n\nThe updated code should end up looking something like this:\nfunction displayCards(mascotsArray) {\n  let mascotsHtml = mascotsArray.map(objectToCard);\n  // ...rest of body ...\n}\n\ndisplayCards(mascots);\n\nNote that this will not change anything... yet!\nPrompting on Button Click\nNext, hook up the button to a basic function that uses prompt to ask for a type by which to filter. Note that the button has an onclick that calls a function named filterList - but it has not been defined!\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the script.js file\nThere, define a new function named filterList\nMake a new line in the body of the filterList function\nThere, create a new variable named type\nSet type to the result of a prompt call\nFor the prompt call, pass in \"What type of mascot do you want to see?\"\n\nThe code for the new filterList function should look something like this so far:\nfunction filterList() {\n  let type = prompt(\"What type of mascot do you want to see?\");\n}\n\nRun the project, click the \"Filter\" button, and verify that the prompt appears!\nDisplaying the Specific Cards\nThe function now knows what type of mascot to display, but... it's not doing anything with that information. Use the filter array method to narrow down the mascots, and then use displayList to display them!\n\nMake a new line under the type variable in the body of the filterList function\nThere, create a new variable named filteredList\nSet filteredList to be a call to mascots.filter\nFor the filter argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with a parameter: m (this is the current mascot)\nNext, the arrow: =>\nNo curly brackets needed\n\n\nIn the body of the function expression, check if m.type is equal to type\nThis way, only mascots with the same type property as the user entered will be in the resulting array!\nNote the implicit return - it's already returning a boolean, so the conditional expression is all that's needed\n\n\nOn the next line, call the displayCards function, and pass in filteredList\n\nThe code should end up looking something like this:\nlet filteredList = mascots.filter(m => m.type === type);\ndisplayCards(filteredList);\n\nRun the project, click the \"Filter\" button, and... maybe something is wrong? Yes, something is wrong! The new cards should be appended correctly, but the old ones are still there!\nClearing the Container\nEvery time the displayList function is called, any existing cards should be removed before the new ones are added.\n\nFind the displayList function\nFind the line where container is defined\nMake a new line under that\nThere, set the innerHTML of the container object to be empty\nMake sure this happens above the mascotsHtml.forEach!\n\n\n\nThe new line should look like this:\ncontainer.innerHTML = \"\";\n\nNow it should work! Try to filter the cards, and make sure it works 😊\nConclusion\nBy the end of the activity, the added code in the script.js file should look something like this:\n// A function to create an HTML \"card\" element from a mascot object\nlet objectToCard = m => {\n  // First create a \n  let mascotCard = document.createElement(\"div\");\n\n  // Add all the HTML text to show the image, name, cereal, and description\n  let cardHTML = `\n    \n      \n      ${m.name}\n      ${m.cereal}\n    \n    ${m.description}\n    `\n\n  // Set the inner HTML of the element\n  mascotCard.innerHTML = cardHTML;\n\n  // Flip the card when it is clicked (toggle the .flipped selector)\n  mascotCard.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n    mascotCard.classList.toggle(\"flipped\");\n  });\n\n  // Return the HTML\n  return mascotCard;\n};\n\n// A function to display a given array of mascot objects\nfunction displayCards(mascotsArray) {\n  // Convert ALL the mascots from the array into HTML Elements\n  let mascotsHtml = mascotsArray.map(objectToCard);\n\n  // Get the containing element\n  let container = document.querySelector(\"#mascot-container\");\n  container.innerHTML = \"\";\n\n  // Append each child to the container\n  mascotsHtml.forEach(m => container.appendChild(m));\n}\n\n// Display the full list to start!\ndisplayCards(mascots);\n\n// A function that displays a filtered list\nfunction filterList() {\n  // Get what type of mascot to display\n  let type = prompt(\"What type of mascot do you want to see?\");\n\n  // filter the list by type\n  let filteredList = mascots.filter(m => m.type === type);\n\n  // display the filtered list\n  displayCards(filteredList);\n}\n\n"},"ArrowFunctions/SelfPacedWork.html":{"url":"ArrowFunctions/SelfPacedWork.html","title":"Self-Paced Work","keywords":"","body":"Self-Paced Work: Trading Card Updates\nFollow these instructions to update the trading card website.\nNew Trading Cards\nCurrently, all the trading cards display information about cereal mascots. If you're a big fan of cereal mascots, that's gr-r-reat! You can add more mascots. If not, you can make entirely new types of trading cards.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the mascots array definition at the top\nAdd at least three new objects\nMake sure to upload pictures for them into the images/ folder!\n\n\nUpdate any of the existing objects as desired\n\nHere are some other ideas for types of trading cards:\n\nSoccer Players Or Other Athletes\nPokemon or Digimon\nMusic Artists Or Bands\nYour Own Friends\nAny Characters From Anything At All\n\nTry to have some fun with it!\nNew Styles\nCurrently, the theme is very yellow-orange looking. Feel free to update the colors, fonts, borders, or any other styles!\nType on Card\nCurrently, each object should contain a type property - but this is actually not shown anywhere. Display it on the front of each card.\nThe type can be shown within a  element (under the cereal name) like so:\nType: animal\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the objectToCard function expression\nWithin the body, find the cardHTML variable\nIn the HTML text, add a  under the existing \nMake the text within the  say Type:\nAfter the colon, add the code to insert the type for the given mascot\n\nThat should be it! Run the project, and very that the type appears on each card.\nCards Unfiltered\nCurrently, after the list has been filtered, there is no way to get back to an unfiltered view of cards. Update the filter so that it is possible to show all cards again! This should happen if the user enters \"all\" when prompted.\nThere are a number of ways to do this. Try to figure out the simplest way!\nSearch Box\nThe filter is cool, but what if someone wanted to search by the name of the mascot? There should be a way to do that!\nHTML & CSS\nStart by creating a new label, text box, and button in the index.html file. Here is a basic rundown of the new elements that must be added:\n\nA piece of text of some kind indicating that the user should enter a \"name\" in the text box box\nAn  with an id attribute set to \"name\"\nThis is so that its value can be retrieved by the JavaScript\n\n\nA  with an onclick attribute that calls a function named filterByName\nThis is so that the list can be filtered when this button is clicked\nThe button should have text that indicates it can be clicked to filter\n\n\n\nIt does not have to look perfect, but it may be a good idea to update some CSS so that the label, text box, and button look nice on the page.\nJavaScript\nThe actual functionality can be added via JavaScript. This will look very similar to the filterList function.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nThere, define a new function named filterByName\nIn the body of the function, define a new variable named nameElement\nSet nameElement to be a call to document.querySelector\nThis should grab the \n\n\nCreate a new variable named name\nSet name to be the nameElement's value\nUnder that, create a new variable named filteredList\nSet filteredList to be a call to mascots.filter\nFor the filter argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with the parameter m\nThen the arrow: =>\n\n\nFor the arrow function body, check if m.name is equal to name\nFinally, call the displayCards function and pass in filteredList\n\nThis should be all that's necessary for a functioning search box! Run the project, enter a full name (with correct capitalization), and verify that only that result appears!\nSearch Box: Starts With\nThe search box is somewhat helpful, but it only works if the user enters the exact name of the mascot. Fix this so that it ignores capitalization, and also only checks if the name starts with the search term.\nThere will be a couple useful string functions for this:\n\ntoLowerCase\nstartsWith\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nFind the filterByName function definition\nIn the body, find the function expression passed into mascots.filter\nAdd curly brackets to the arrow function expression\nIn the body (between the new { and }), make a new line\nThere, create a new variable named nameLc\nSet nameLc to be the name from the text box in all lowercase\nUnder that, create a new variable named mNameLc\nSet mNameLc to be the mascot's name in all lowercase\nUnder that, create a new variable named nameStartsWith\nSet nameStartsWith to check if mNameLc starts with the letters from nameLc\nUse a return statement to return the nameStartsWith variable value\n\nThat should be it! Test out the function to make sure it returns the properly filtered list. \nSearch Box: On Text Changed\nThis is working pretty well! But it may get annoying to keep clicking that \"Filter by Name\" button. Luckily, it is possible to automatically run a function whenever text is input.\n\nOpen the script.js file for editing\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCreate a new variable named nameElement\nStore the  in the nameElement variable\nCall addEventListener on nameElement\nPass in \"input\" as the first argument\nFor the second argument, create a new arrow function expression\nStart with parentheses: ()\nThen the arrow symbol: =>\nThen curly brackets: {}\n\n\nMake a new line within the curly brackets\nThere, call the filterByName function\n\nRun the project and see how it works! When text is entered in the \"name\" box, the list should filter automatically.\nSearch Box: Refactoring and Updating\nThe search box is working, but there are a few updates that might make it better:\n\nIt should not have to get the nameElement variable more than once\nIt should filter by text in any part of the name (not just the beginning)\nThe \"Filter by Name\" button can be removed\nThe text box should look nicer\nIt could check against cereal in addition to name\nIt could check against description and type as well\nThere could be multiple fields for the different object properties\n\nThere are a ton of other possible enhancements - try to improve the site in any way you can!\n"},"MidSemesterReview/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 6 - Mid-Semester Review","keywords":"","body":"Mid-Semester Review\nUse this session to review the concepts covered so far!\nOptions\nYou can choose from a number of options:\n\n🐜 Fix some bugs\n💪 Complete some challenges\n📚 Expand your knowledge\n🛵 Kickstart your project\n\n"},"MidSemesterReview/BugFixing.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/BugFixing.html","title":"Bug Fixing","keywords":"","body":"Bug Fixing\nFind and fix all the issues with these projects.

This is the most complex of the functions in the script.js file. It displays a table with every item in the cart array. There are many different parts to this function.\nCart  Setup\nThe top of the function prepares the HTML  element. It follows this process:\n\nGrab the  from the HTML\nStored in a variable named cartContainer\n\n\nSet the innerHTML of the cartContainer to include...\nA \nA  within the \n elements within the  for Item, Price, Quantity, and Total\n\n\nGrab the newly created , stored in the cartTable variable\n\nNow the cartTable is ready for item rows!\nLooping Through the cart with forEach\nThe next part of the function loops through each item value in the cart, and adds a row to the table for each one. It follows this process:\n\nCreate a new  element, stored in a variable named itemRow\nCorrectly format the price in the itemPrice variable\nCalculate the total for the row, stored in the itemTotal variable\nSet the innerHTML of the itemRow to include...\nA  for the item's name\nA  for the item's price\nA  for the item's quantity\nA  for the item's total\n\n\nFinally, append the new itemRow to the cartTable\n\nBy this point, every item is in the table - but it's not done just yet!\nAdding the Final Cart Table Row\nThere will be one row of the cart table that includes the total of all items together. This part follows this process:\n\nCreate a new  element, stored in a variable named finalRow\nUse reduce to sum up the grand total of all the items together (grandTotal)\nThis takes a function with two parameters: the total, and the next item\nThe total from the next item is added to the total, and then returned\n\n\n0 is passed as the starter value for the total\nNote: This is an advanced topic, so don't worry too much about fully grasping it!\n\n\nSet the innerHTML of the finalRow to include...\nA bolded  saying \"Total\"\nA bolded  containing the totalCost\n\n\nFinally, append the finalRow to the cartTable\n\nThat's all! The  in the HTML will now contain a header row, a row for each item, and a final row. The viewCart function is called every time a new item is added to the cart.\nThe End\nThe last thing to do is to call buildMenu on the sandwiches array - this adds all the sandwiches (as well as their plus buttons) to the page!\nThere is quite a bit of code, but learning how to navigate and update existing code (even if it's a little difficult to understand) is an incredibly valuable skill to learn. Try to complete some of these challenges to practice.\nChallenge 1: More Sandwiches\nCurrently, there are only three sandwiches. This is a pretty weak offering. Update the initial sandwiches array to include at least two (2) new items!\nWhat to Add\nThere are already images for a Club Sandwich (images/club.jpg) and a Veggie Sandwich (images/veg.jpg) built into the project. However, this menu can contain anything you would like! Feel free to change it up and offer entirely new options as desired. They don't even have to be food items!\nChallenge 2: Menu Item Prices\nCurrently, the menu displays the name, picture, and description for each item. However, the price is not displayed anywhere! Update the itemElement HTML to include each item's price!\nWhere to Add the Price\nThere are a few different ways to display the price. For example, it could look be added within parentheses at the end of the description:\n\nThe important thing is add the dollar sign, and try to make it stand out a little bit. Play around and see what looks good!\nChallenge 3: Removal Button\nCurrently, once an item has been added to the cart, there is no way to remove it. This may be good for business, but customers may not like it very much. Add a removal button to each menu item that will remove the item from the cart!\nThere are a few ways to do this, but the ultimate goal is to have a - button next to the + button that will reduce the quantity of the given item in the cart by 1. If it exists...\nAdded Challenge: Dynamic Display\nFor the base of this challenge, the - button could be displayed regardless of how many items are in the cart. As an added challenge, try to show the - button only when there is at least one of the item in the cart.\nChallenge 4: Cart Quantity Updates\nThis challenge may involve a fair amount of additional work. Currently, the Quantity of each item in the cart is displayed as a static number. Turn each Quantity cell into a dynamic, update-able value. It could look something like this:\n\nNote that with every quantity update, the cart (and total price calculations) should update as well.\nChallenge 5: Cart Storage\nThe site is coming together, but what if a customer accidentally closes out of the page before they checkout??????? What would we do???? All their hard work of building their cart would be gone!!!!!!!!\nLuckily, there is a way to persist data locally.\nBackground: Local Storage\nThis is possible using something called localStorage - it's basically a way to store data in the browser for a given user. This can make basic front-end web applications much more powerful!\nlocalStorage has two main functions: storing values (setting), and retrieving values (getting).\nSetting an Item\nSetting an item looks like this:\nlet myValue = \"This will be stored\";\n\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myValue\", myValue);\n\nGetting an Item\nIf an item has already been stored, you can get it like this:\nlet myValue = localStorage.getItem(\"myValue\");\n\nChallenge\nUpdate the project so that instead of storing everything in a local cart variable, all the data is stored in a localStorage item.\n"},"MidSemesterReview/Library.html":{"url":"MidSemesterReview/Library.html","title":"Library","keywords":"","body":"Library\nFeel free to browse through these resources.\nArticles\nHere are some articles to read.\n\nNew York Times: Alan Turing\nWikipedia: History of Nintendo\nWikipedia: Atari video game burial\nDEV: A Brief History of JavaScript\nWikipedia: JavaScript\nWikipedia: Technological singularity\n\nVideos\nHere are some videos to watch.\n\n15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes\nTom Scott: This Video Has 63,225,114 Views\nTom Scott: Will YouTube Ever Run Out Of Video IDs?\nTom Scott: The Worst Typo I Ever Made\nTom Scott: FizzBuzz: One Simple Interview Question\nThe Digital Computer (Bits and Bytes, Episode 1)\nHow Quantum Computers Break Encryption\nhangman is a weird game\n\n"},"FinalProject/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"FinalProject/StudentDesc.html","title":"Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Final Project\nUhhhhh make something cool\n"}}}
