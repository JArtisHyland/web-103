# Arrow Functions
This lesson introduces [arrow functions](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics) as another way to define functions. It also introduces some array methods for iteration ([`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)) that really showcase the power of arrow function syntax.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize the different syntax to define functions
- Pass anonymous arrow functions to other functions
- Understand the power of syntactic sugar
- Practice using functions like `map` and `filter` on arrays
