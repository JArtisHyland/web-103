# API Review & Examples
This lesson reviews concepts from the [API Consumption](../ApiConsumption/) lesson, and provides a broader view of API usage in the real world.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Gain a deeper understanding of APIs
- See more examples of APIs they can use
- Feel more comfortable using `fetch`
- Confidently handle different types of JSON responses

## Self-Paced Work: Dog Fetcher Updates
Students can start by working on the [self-paced work from the previous lesson](../ApiConsumption/DogFetcherSelfPacedWork.md). This should help them review the material in a comfortable environment.

## Review: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](TODO). Note than an account is required to host the game.

## Code-Along: What Does the Cat Say?
Follow [the instructions](CatSayCodeAlong.md) to build a website that displays pictures of cats with messages.

## Examples
Introduce [the examples](Examples.md) to show students more of what is possible with APIs. Students should have an opportunity to explore and modify a variety of API-driven front-end web applications.
