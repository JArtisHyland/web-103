# Warm-Up: Function Machine
In JavaScript, [functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics) are a way to run a piece of code on-demand. Parameters are used as function input, and returns are used to give back an output. In math, the concept of functions is similar - often, math functions take some sort of input, and produce an output. In this warm-up, play a math-inspired function game to practice using input and output.

## Function Machine
[Click here to access the Function Machine game.](https://www.mathplayground.com/functionmachine.html)

The goal is to figure out the "code" for a math function based on its input and output.

- Start with the **Beginner** mode, then move onto the **Advanced**
- Click **Instructions** in the upper right to see some detailed instructions
- Choose a difficulty with the numbers in the **Choose an Activity Level** box at the bottom
- Try to figure out the **Advanced Level 3** - that's the hardest one!

## Additional Games
There are some additional math/code games that are not directly related to the concept of functions, but feel free to try them out:
