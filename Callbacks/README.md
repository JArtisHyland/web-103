# Functions & Callbacks
Introduce [callbacks](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_callback.asp) as a way to use functions as variables and parameters.

This lesson is fairly conceptual, and it may be difficult for students to grasp - however, using callbacks will become quite important when working with APIs.

## Warm-Up: TODO
Have the students complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md).

## Lecture: Functions & Callbacks
The [presentation](FunctionsAndCallbacks.pptx) reviews functions, and shows how they can be used for callbacks. There are a few code examples.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
TODO

## Code-Along: TODO
Follow the [instructions](CodeAlong.md) to build up a website.

## Self-Paced Work: TODO
Have the students follow [the instructions](SelfPacedWork.md) to continue working on the website.

## Challenges
There are some additional [challenges](Challenges.md).
