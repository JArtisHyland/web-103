# Web 103: Advanced JavaScript
This course expands upon the material from Web 102, and dives deeper into more JavaScript concepts. Students will learn about objects, data, functional programming, asynchronous execution, and more! By the end of the semester, students should be able to create an advanced website that connects to an external API and dynamically updates based on real live information.

## Outline

- [Week 1: JavaScript Review](JsReview/)
- [Week 2: Arrays](Arrays/)
- [Week 3: Objects / JSON](Objects/)
- Week 4: Callbacks (adapted from Web 201)
- Week 5: Arrow Functions (could maybe be combined with above)
- Week 6: Review/Check-Ins
- Week 7: Promises (conceptually) + `async`/`await`
- Week 8: `try`/`catch` (could maybe be combined with above, or swapped)
- Week 9: Consuming an API (ultimate goal)
- Week 10: Review & Final Project Introduction
- Week 11: Final Project Work
- Week 12: Final Project Presentations

## Resources & Ideas
Here are some thoughts and things.

- [Vanilla Log-in](https://github.com/developer-job-simulation/vanilla-login-form)
  - Help students find/fix bugs
  - Expose students to GitHub/version control/open source
  - May fit better in a future course
- Additional Topics: modules, spread operator, ternary operator, destructuring
  - These may come in handy in the future, especially when working with React and any existing code written by someone else

## Learning Objectives
The goal of this course is _not_ to teach programming concepts; it is to show students how they can build more advanced front-end web applications using vanilla JavaScript. Each concept learned should have a direct application and purpose. The ultimate aim is for students to build a website that connects to an external API.

## Final Project Possibilities
A student might attempt to build a cat quote generator like this: [https://getcat.josephmaxwell.repl.co/](https://getcat.josephmaxwell.repl.co/).

There are a ton of public APIs available, and a bunch of them are listed here: [https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). It would be beneficial to search through the APIs, find a few simple ones, and make small demonstration websites for them.
